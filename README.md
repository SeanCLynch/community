## Welcome!

Now more than ever, citizens in a democracy must have a place for healthy and constructive discussion. Our [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) used to fill this role and our virtual places were supposed to replace them. Despite their shortcomings, the desire for civic engagement remains strong and our hope lies in our Community.
