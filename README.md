## Welcome!

Young people in 2017 are ill-equiped to become responsible, engaged citizens. They have been deprived of strong local neighborhoods, a fair press and a proper understanding of their role. Our disappearing [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) and their thoroughly flawed digital counterparts in social media  leave young people no place in their lives for practicing citizenship. Without this place, without exercising our civic responsibilities, society becomes susceptible to unchecked and unwanted change. 

This project aims to build that space, both digital and physical, for people today. 

### Features

#### Local, digital space

Create communities with designated boundries, only users within those boundries will be allowed to enter, as well as a couple guests at a time. 

#### Talk and share

Post links, write stories, chat, just hang a while and listen. Feel free to drop by when your looking for some informal, relaxed community time. 

#### Pop the filter bubble

Discussing both popular and unpopular opinions is required to increase your influence in the community temporarily. 

#### Civic moderation

Citizns can vote on important aspects of their community, such as size and layout, and take turns at tough but enlightening roles like moderation. 

#### Ending the Eternal September

Online communities occasionally suffer from being too scalable for their own good. Let your community grow at a pace everyone is comfortable with.
